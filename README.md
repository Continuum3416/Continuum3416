- I’m interested in PDEs modelling, computer vision, high-performance computing, scientific simulation, and low-latency C/C++
- I'm currently working on a CUDA-accelerated ray tracer and a 3D physics engine
- Favorite languages: C, C++, CUDA, Rust, and Python
- Less favorable: Javascript
- I also do web dev (only when needed)
